# THIS IS MALWARE
To anyone browsing this page, this repository is a crude attempt at inserting malware into the legitimate `mathjs` package. This package was then distributed to npm under `mathjs-min`. 

***DO NOT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE***. It contains a token/credential grabber in the `sqrt` function.
